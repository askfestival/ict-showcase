    <p>
Detailed Description
Augmented Reality (AR) enhances the real world by layering digital content—such as images, videos, sounds, 3D objects, or text—on top of what we see around us. Instead of replacing reality, AR adds to it. This technology works through devices like smartphones, tablets, AR glasses, and head-mounted displays, using cameras, sensors, GPS, and artificial intelligence to understand the environment in real time.
For example, AR can recognize physical objects, faces, or locations and display relevant information instantly. A phone camera might show directions on the road, labels on buildings, or instructions floating over a machine you’re repairing.
Future Use
In the future, AR will:
•	Revolutionize education by showing interactive 3D models of organs, planets, or historical events in classrooms.
•	Improve navigation with real-time directions projected onto streets or sidewalks.
•	Transform shopping by allowing users to try clothes, makeup, or furniture virtually before buying.
•	Enhance healthcare by helping doctors visualize organs, guide surgeries, and train medical students.
•	Support workplaces by providing hands-free instructions and real-time data for technicians and engineers.
AR will make everyday life more informative, efficient, and interactive without disconnecting us from the real world.</p>
