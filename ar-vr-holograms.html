<h1>AR, VR & Holograms</h1>

<div class="card">
    <h2>Augmented Reality (AR)</h2>
    <p>
        Augmented Reality is a technology that overlays digital content such as images,
        videos, or text onto the real world. AR does not replace reality but enhances it.
        It is commonly used in mobile applications, education, navigation, and gaming.
        AR helps users interact with digital objects while staying connected to the
        physical environment.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>Virtual Reality (VR)</h2>
    <p>
        Virtual Reality is a technology that creates a fully immersive digital environment.
        Users wear VR headsets to experience a simulated world that feels real.
        VR is used in gaming, training simulations, medical practice, and virtual tours.
        It allows users to explore places and situations that may be difficult or
        dangerous to experience in real life.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>Holograms</h2>
    <p>
        Holograms are three-dimensional images created using light technology.
        Unlike normal images, holograms appear to float in space and can be viewed
        from different angles. Holograms are used in education, medical visualization,
        entertainment, and advanced communication systems.
        They help display information in a more realistic and interactive way.
