    <h2>⏳ Past of AI</h2>
    <p>
        In the past, Artificial Intelligence focused on basic rule-based systems
        that followed pre-programmed instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI was used in calculators, early computer games, and expert systems such
        as simple medical diagnosis and chess programs.

    <h2>⚙️ Present of AI</h2>
    <p>
        Today, AI uses machine learning and deep learning to analyze data and make
        intelligent decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI is commonly used in voice assistants, recommendation systems,
        facial recognition, and healthcare.
