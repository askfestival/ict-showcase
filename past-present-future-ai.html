<h1>Past, Present & Future of Artificial Intelligence</h1>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Past of AI</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence began in the mid-20th century when scientists
        started exploring whether machines could think like humans.
        Early AI systems were rule-based, meaning they followed fixed instructions
        written by programmers. One of the pioneers, Alan Turing, introduced
        the Turing Test to check if a machine could behave intelligently.
        Due to limited computing power and data, early AI systems were slow
        and could perform only simple tasks.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Present of AI</h2>
    <p>
        Today, Artificial Intelligence has become an important part of everyday life.
        Modern AI systems use machine learning and deep learning to learn from large
        amounts of data. AI is used in smartphones, voice assistants, medical diagnosis,
        recommendation systems, self-driving cars, and online education.
        With faster computers and advanced algorithms, AI can now recognize speech,
        images, and patterns with high accuracy.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Future of AI</h2>
    <p>
        In the future, AI is expected to become more intelligent and independent.
        It may help humans solve complex problems such as climate change,
        disease detection, and space exploration. Future AI systems may work
        closely with humans rather than replacing them.
        However, the development of AI also raises ethical concerns about privacy,
        job security, and responsible use of technology.
