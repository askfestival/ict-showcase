<h1>Past, Present & Future of Artificial Intelligence</h1>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Past of AI</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence began in the mid-20th century when scientists
        started exploring whether machines could think like humans.
        Early AI systems were rule-based, meaning they followed fixed instructions
        written by programmers. Alan Turing introduced the Turing Test.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Present of AI</h2>
    <p>
        Today, AI uses machine learning and deep learning.
        It is used in smartphones, voice assistants, medical diagnosis,
        recommendation systems, and self-driving cars.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Future of AI</h2>
    <p>
        In the future, AI may help solve problems like climate change and disease detection,
        but it also raises ethical concerns such as privacy and job security.
