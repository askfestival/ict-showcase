<h1>Careers in Artificial Intelligence</h1>

<div class="job">
    <h2>🤖 1. Machine Learning Engineer</h2>
    <p>A Machine Learning Engineer designs, builds, and maintains systems that allow computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. They work at the intersection of software engineering, data science, and artificial intelligence. Their job includes selecting algorithms, training models on large datasets, optimizing performance, and deploying models into real-world applications.

They also ensure models are scalable, reliable, and efficient, often working with cloud platforms and big data technologies. Machine Learning Engineers turn raw data into intelligent systems that can make predictions or decisions on their own.

Future Use

In the future, Machine Learning Engineers will:

Develop safer and more reliable self-driving vehicles

Create highly personalized recommendation systems for entertainment, shopping, and learning

Improve medical diagnosis systems that detect diseases earlier and more accurately

Enhance fraud detection and cybersecurity systems

Support smart cities through traffic control, energy management, and public safety solutions
